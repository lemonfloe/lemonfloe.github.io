		The game that got us hooked was Tetris 99, and we continued to play modern VS stackers for a long while after.
		We then expanded our focus onto the "Tetris The Grand Master" subseries and have made achievements notable to us
		there.

	<p>Notable achievements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>

	<p>We got Splatoon 2 on launch and have been big fans since.</p>
	<p>FA Summary:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>2600 XP (Japan)</li>
		<li>Estimated Div 4 LUTI</li>
		<li>Past Teams: <a href="https://twitter.com/ResonanceSpl">Resonance</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Our first experience in competitive Splatoon was for a new team formed in June of 2023. For one year
		as the team's frontline, our team <a href="https://twitter.com/ominous_spl">Ominous</a> pushed
		off-meta weapons in tournament play, enough to promote to ~Div 4.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ominous has since rebranded to <a href="https://twitter.com/ResonanceSpl">Resonance</a>, and
		although we no longer play for the team, they are still amazing friends. You should check them out!
