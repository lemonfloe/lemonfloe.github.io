    <p>
        The first Tetris game we played a lot of was Tetris 99, and for a long while we focused on playing
        modern-style stackers. Our current focus is on the "Tetris The Grand Master" subseries.

    <p>We got into Splatoon with the 2nd game on Switch, and have been big fans since.</p>

    <p>FA Summary:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2600 XP (Japan)</li>
        <li>Estimated Div 4 LUTI</li>
        <li>Past Teams: <a href="https://twitter.com/ResonanceSpl">Resonance</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Our first experience in competitive Splatoon was for a new team formed in June of 2023. For one year
        as the team's frontline, our team <a href="https://twitter.com/ominous_spl">Ominous</a> pushed
        off-meta weapons in tournament play and managed to promote into mid level.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ominous has since rebranded to <a href="https://twitter.com/ResonanceSpl">Resonance</a>, and
        although we no longer play for the team, they are still amazing friends. You should check them out!
